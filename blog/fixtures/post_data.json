    "text": "Django 1.8 is Django's newest version, and the next version slated for Long-Term Support (LTS). LTS means that Django 1.8 will be supported for longer than regular versions: Django core developers will specify a single release as LTS, and then continue to update that version regardless of the usual release cycle. This will last until they pick a new LTS version, which typically happens every 3 to 4 years. The last LTS version was 1.4, released in March 2012, which will stop being supported in October 2015.\n\nFor more information: \nhttp://andrewsforge.com/article/upgrading-django-to-17/part-1-introduction-and-django-releases/",
